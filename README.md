3	WORK EXPERIENCE

In the scope of CIU regulations 30-day compulsory internship, the research for an appropriate company to realize the internship started. After a while, thanks to one of academicians in Cyprus International University, Faculty Of Engineering, Computer & Information Systems Engineering Department, Invaco Teknoloji A.Ş. had been discovered and chosen for internship.

During the internship, Yunus Onur Atasoy and Eren Çetinkaya, IT personnels of Invaco Teknoloji A.Ş., have been mostly communicated with. While supporting the projects, Android Studio and Visual Studio Code for Phyton have been chosen.

In this chapter, the work experience during internship is explained under 3 category; Problem Definition, Work Done and Limitations & Experiences Gained.
3.1	Problem Definition 

As explained in previous chapters, the internship has been realized in order to experience the application of knowledge on the profession on site, and to learn the methods and studies for solving programming problems, to be able to have the personnel criteria that digitized companies in the sector are looking for.

The Information Technology Department is the section that communicates with client company, understands their problems, gets to know the client company technology infrastructure closer, understands client company’s business process, brings the most appropriate solutions to client company’s technologic and digital needs, writes the proper codes and create demanding software systems or applications, gives other related services such as Cloud Based Services. The internship process has been full of tasks and projects undertaken at the Information Technology Department. As mentioned at the beginning of paper, the entire internship has taken place in online environment due to COVID-19 pandemic. It did not cause any problem, thanks to digitalization of the world.

As a beginning for the internship, the meeting with Yunus Onur Atasoy who is a software engineer and has been the supervisor for my internship. All the tasks and projects prepared by myself and delivered to the company were controlled and tracked via Trello. Before beginning the projects, the first step was to recognize and discover the software languages and other technologies being used within the company. Secondly, Phyton Software Language were searched and many arcticles have been read to accomplish the 1st Project. As a third step, Java Programming Lanuage and Twilio Library which are used by the company was examined in detail to complete the 2nd Project, by the reason of that Information Technology Department especially demanded the use of Twilio Library. As last step, projects have been finished and delivered on time to the supervisor. There has been few problems faced during internship such as an error caused by an old version of videoview element given by supervisor. The reason of use of Phyton as programming language is that the company generally use Phyton in their businesses and recommended Phyton to me while progressing the First Project. Besides, considering large corporations, they mostly prefer Phyton as their basic programming language due to ease of use, flexibility, adaptability, wide-scale libraries access. Today, many of business, consulting firms, software engineers, business analysts focus on Phyton because there has been a wide range of sectors which Phyton has bring solutions. For instance, creating Web applications, face and voice recognization, traffic jam problems, entire process from unstructured data to meaningful information. It is a well-known fact that having improved Phyton skills is quite necessary for deep learning and machine learning.

In order to demonstrate how and in which way the tasks and the projects have been generated during the internship, the softwares, tools, computer programs and other technologies will be explained briefly in following sections.

3.1.1	Programming Languages
As previously mentioned, there were 2 projects expected to be accomplished until the end of the internship. For the first project, it was asked to use Phyton programming Language. Phyton is general-purpose coding or programming language at high level productivity and it is commonly preferred in machine learning, Fintech, data science, scientific computing and general Web development.

In order for 2nd Project, Java was used as programming language due to it is an Android application. Kotlin Programming Language could also be used in the process of generating Android application for the 2nd Project, however the supervisor especially gave instruction to choose Java programming language. Java is a programming language and operating platform. It is now ubiquitous from laptops to storage centers, from play consoles to scientific super computers, from mobile phones to Internet.  

3.1.2 Technologic Tools
During the process of generating 2nd Project, many tools have been benefitted from. One of these tools is Android Studio  which was used at a critical point. Android Studio provides a unified environment where you can build apps for Android devices such as phones, tablets, TVs. Structured code modules allow you to divide your project into units of functionality that you can independently build, test, and debug.

In the upcoming parts of 2nd Project, Sonarlint Application has been used. It is an Eclipse plugin that provides on-the-fly feedback to developers on new bugs an quality issues injected into Java, JavaScript and PHP code. 

Regarding to the use of programming languages and varied technologic tools, internship has developed my current knowledge beyond that ever expected. Besides, the supervisor, Yunus Onur Atasoy, mostly has been leading during the projects, asked for many revises, and sahared his experiences and recommended many more easy ways about how to build Android applications, correct errors and how to manage a project. As planned before the internship, the knowledge received through school had been converted into practices and experiences during the internship.
3.2	Work Done
In the Problem Definition part, it was explained that what tasks are given and which projects has been prepared or what kind of programming languages and technologic tools have been used during the internship. In this part, it will be presented in detail that what has been done with previously explained tools and programming languages to accomplish the tasks and projects.

The daily report of entire internship has been summarized and together with all data coming from this daily reports, Table 3.2 was created. It demonstrates how the aforementioned 2 projects have been managed and given tasks were accomplished step-by-step.

Day 34 	I wrote the SetCameraChange method. First, I assigned a default camera at application opening. With the SetCameraChange method, I determined which camera it was on with ‘if’ query. According to the result of the query, I changed my variable 'CameraCapturer' which sends images to the camera. And I sent the application report.
Day 35 	I added Google Firebase's Crashlytics feature. Then we realized a user test with an IT engineer. I made a clean copy of the application. I wrote comments about what the methods do. Finally, I have delivered the 2nd Project.

Table 3.1 Summary of Daily Report of Internships


3.2.1	Project 1 : An application that assigns mouse functions to the joystick and game controller via Python
It is a project about an application that basicly assigning the mouse functions to the joystick and game controller. In other words, The application has been built via Phyton Programming Language and to run on desktop computers and Windows operating system. Here is a template demonstrating what exactly was performed in order to create the application as in Figure 3.1.



3.2.2	Project 2 : An application that takes video images on the Android platform and broadcasts it on the screen
The 2nd Project has entailed much more intensive attention than the first project. The time needed to finish was quite longer, the effort needed to continue the process accurately was more. The objective of this project is to create an application that takes video images on the Android platform and broadcasts it on the screen. In other words, the application provides a passage or a changeover between front camera to back camera. Here is an illustrative visuals demosntrating what exactly was performed to create this application as in Figure 3.2 and Figure 3.3.
3.3	Limitations and Experience Gained
Within 30-day internship, there has been few malfunctions as well as great experiences. In this section, the problems and missings faced during realizing projects and tasks explained earlier and how the process could be enhanced will be analysed in detail.

3.3.1	Problems Faced
During the preparation process of 2nd Project, naturally, there were some problems regarding the inharmoniousness between Video Texture View and XML File. The aim was to play the local video with Video Texture View, however when added Video Texture View to the XML File, a failure has become apparent. The problem was shared over stackoverflow.com in order to find a solution from someone who experience similar issue. Figure 3.4 displays all the details of problem faced.

However, after searching the reason of problem for a while, it has been found out that the method used at first by myself was old version of Videoview elements and no longer valid.  Since the videoview element version the engineer gave me is old, therefore view could not reached. This videoview element is a tool of Twilio Library. After realizing the originated reason of the error, the supervisor has given an advise for a new method that will not create a problem. Later on, the project has been progressed with the use of new method advised by supervisor. The method has been controlled over Sonarlint in order to determine the errors if there is any. Finally there was no found failure and projects has continued to progress. Discovering the problem and later reorganizing and straighten the inharmoniousness by new recommended method has taken time. The solution of this project has been generated as seen in Figure3.3 MultiTouch Control.


3.3.2	What was missing/lacking?
The most bone-deep failure to fulfilment about the company is that there were no qualified software engineer at high-level in Information Technology Department. This one of the disadvantages of realizing internship at a start-up business. While preparing the applications, the software engineer in the department have mostly come with the response of that they do not know how to fix it when a problem or a failure has been appeared. None of advantages of working for large corporations have been appeared. This circumstance have made the stages of the management of given projects crawled and moved further so slowly. The reason is that all the failures had to be searched and solved by myself and my own skills. 

From a different point of view, insufficiency of software engineer in Information Technology Department forced my technical skills to be improved in a very short term. 

3.3.3	How could you have done your work better?
More time in internship would make the experience gaining more efficient. Restricted time especially for those who works in information technology sector do not enable to have full knowledge on site. However, limited time also pushes individuals to accomplish the tasks more effective due to that they have to produce more output (information) with limited resources (time). 


3.3.4	How could you have gained more experience?
Taking parts in different projects and serving to companies from different industries would lead my technical skills to be developed. By this way, having a comprehensive knowledge of all kind of usage of technologies and tools in different sectors will be likely and easily. However, choosing a start-up business in order to do internship became an obstacle to experience the use of technologies and tool in large corporations and in varied industries. If a corporation would be chosen, More experience could be gained and more knowledge could be reached beyond now.


3.3.5	What did you learn in summary?
During the internship Phyton programming language, Twilio Library and Java programming language have been searched and gained a large scale of information about this technologic tools. How to conduct a project management stage-by-stage has been learned in detail. What have learned at school theorytically has been transformed into practical experiences.


3.3.6	How will this experience help you in the future?
As mentioned before, limited time occasionally affects people to be more effective. Hence 30-day internship helped to improve my practical skills in restricted time. Certainly, it will be quite essential in today’s competitive private business environment. The more you produce within the shorter time is the most wanted strength by employees.  

Moreover, gaining a large scale of Phyton, Java and also Twilio Library knowledge during the preparing process will help to focus on artificial intelligence, and how to be more creative with the channels of these programming languages and technologic tools.

Besides, doing internship in a start-up business has pushed my skills to be improved due to that the only person who can bring solutions to the problems faced was myself. Being an expert in the field of digital technology is not enough to be successful. Due to that business are involving people who works together, social relations and disciplines are also essential at this point. Learning how to organize a discipline of work and how to manage a project in a systematic framework and taking responsibilities will make it easier to progress in future career line.

4	 CONCLUSION
To sum up 30-day compulsory internship realized at Invaco Teknoloji, in general, there has been many advantages as well as disadvantages. At the beginning, this company has been chosen due to it is a start-up business, and facing with all failures of a start-up business, would improve my analytic problem-solving skills. When you do not have any chance to learn what you need from someone who is an expert in the field, you must figure out what is needed to be done in order to solve the problem by yourself and continue the process. This was the one of the biggest advantages of the internship. 

Regarding to the work environment, the supervisor, Yunus Onur Atasoy, and other software engineer, Emre Çetinkaya, was kind and helpful to the problems I have faced as they can. In Information Technology Department, sometimes the problems are thought, discussed, solutions are brought, ideas are argued with all positive and negative sides but it was not as efficient as in my expectations before the internship. This situation is caused by there are not enough personnels in the company and exiting employers do not have enough qualifications in order to answer all my questions. Certainly, the circumstance would be more different if a large corporation with more software engineers at high-level qualifications. Moreover, it was quite hard to reach the company by any channel and receive responses to my questions for preparing internship report after the internship. As mentioned in earlier parts, the internship was realized in digital environment, and it is likelihood that these problems originated from not working face-to-face. 

From the technical information view of point, the best and the most important advantage of the internship is that discovering Phyton, Java and Twilio Library by own myself broaden my horizons at technical field. When a chance appear to work with artificial intelligence in future, Phyton and Java knowledge and skills will be very important in order to be successful.

In general, it has been a full of hard-worked and enormously productive of 30-days internship for me beyond the expectations before the internship. Within just a month, finishing two projects involving creating application and readjusting the tasks due to the supervisor revise demands have been extremely intense. These hard-worked 30 days will have a positively great impact on my future career.
